              It is a high priority that the NPCs within the game have a rich
              Animation Controller. Currently, the NPCs will dance no matter
              what is happening in the game. To fix this, I have implemented
              logic that checks what state the NPCs should be in, and sets it
              accordingly to that animation. Now the NPCs can either idle if
              they do not like the music or there is no music playing, or dance
              if music is playing and it is a genre that they like. Logic is
              present for the NPCs walking in and out of the scene, however it
              is not detectable or triggerable within the game yet.

              I have also optimised the GitHub repository to properly ignore
              Unityâ€™s large temporary files. This meant that I could also
              uninstall LFS. This allows for less commit errors and generally
              greater compatibility.

              Today, I have finished off the PowerPoint slides for the project
              proposal. The majority of information was already written in my
              game design document, however additional information had to be
              written due to it being previously missing or outdated since the
              last iteration of the prototype. Screenshots and a video were also
              made, and then edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.

            <p class="blog-text">
              Today, I implemented major features into the game. Ensuring that a
              duplicate number of NPCs does not spawn is crucial. There cannot
              be an equal number of NPCs spawning in, since that would cause a
              dilemma where the player will not be able to select the correct
              genre to get awarded points. Now, the game runs a check to see if
              there are no equal numbers of NPCs, and if so, adjusts the number
              of NPCs to be all different.

              A scoring system has also been implemented. All major sensing
              mechanics have been implemented, however, currently the game only
              awards points for playing any track, and also awards points for
              playing the most popular genres. Coroutines had to be used, and a
              lot of conditional statements. Since I have already anticipated
              appropriate music genre sensing, implementing scoring conditions
              was relatively simple. However, major parts of code had to be
              re-written for the spawning of NPCs and also allowing the scripts
              to globally manipulate clones of NPCs.
