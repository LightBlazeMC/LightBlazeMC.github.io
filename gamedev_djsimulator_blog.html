              focus towards the dissertation side of the project. I have begun

            <p class="blog-text">
              An end game condition is a must and even at this late point in
              development is still absent. In order to be able to test and debug
              the game properly from the beginning to the end, this must now be
              present. I have focussed on implementing this. A 5-minute timer
              has been added so that the player has a time limit to amass the
              most points. The duration of the timer may be adjustable in a
              feature in the settings/free play mode.

              When the timer is over, the game will display the player’s score
              and return to the main menu. This has been implemented within the
              game manager, and a game over manager. Currently, the screen is
              very basic since it is in the testing stage, but a design in line
              with the aesthetics of the rest of the game will be implemented
              eventually.

              After the migration to the new NPC management systems, a lot of
              the game logic became incompatible and was either buggy or broken.
              This week, I have tested for bugs and fixed them, ensuring that
              the game is fully functional with the new NPC management logic.
              The game failed to properly sense and count NPCs, so that has now
              been fixed, and variable conflicts causing erroneous data have
              been solved.

              I also took this opportunity to further improve the animation
              logic for the NPCs. I have shortened animation times, in order for
              the animation logic to respond and flow much faster. I have used
              Unity’s synchronisation tool that shows if the animation will loop
              well. This has allowed me to reduce the animation times, while
              maintaining a smooth and natural animation.

              I have also built an entrance within the map for the NPCs to spawn
              inside of, ensuring that they do not randomly show up in the
              corner. To make it look more interesting, I have added point
              lights to simulate an appropriate ambiance. Doing this enhances
              the level design and also ensures a natural way for the NPCs to
              spawn in.

              Following the interim demo, it has been agreed that a system for
              NPC spawning and de-spawning needs to be in place. Currently, the
              game generates and auto-balances the NPC count at the start of the
              game, and never again. This leads to very boring gameplay. I need
              to figure out a way for the NPCs to spawn in and de-spawn during
              the playthrough, as to keep the game alive and interesting. I can
              then use the NPC animations implemented earlier in order to make
              the movements seem natural. For this to happen, a major NPC
              Manager and NPC Animation Manager overhaul is in place.

              The NPCs now spawn in at a set location. They will then start
              walking after a random amount of time, for a random period of
              time. This is to better space out the NPCs so that they do not
              clip and crowd. They will then randomly select a direction angle,
              and walk a random distance. All of the randomisation is in place
              in order to better and more naturally simulate a crowd and to
              create spacing. Walking, idling and dancing animations are now
              properly controlled and triggered by the NPC Animation Manager.

              An in-game menu has been made in order to allow the player to
              return to the menu. This is a simple implementation, due to the
              fact that scene management logic for the main menu and cutscenes
              already exists, so that can be repurposed. It is important to have
              this menu, otherwise the player would have to force quit the game
              to select a different game mode, which of course is a very poor
              example of user experience.

              It is a high priority that the NPCs within the game have a rich
              Animation Controller. Currently, the NPCs will dance no matter
              what is happening in the game. To fix this, I have implemented
              logic that checks what state the NPCs should be in, and sets it
              accordingly to that animation. Now the NPCs can either idle if
              they do not like the music or there is no music playing, or dance
              if music is playing and it is a genre that they like. Logic is
              present for the NPCs walking in and out of the scene, however it
              is not detectable or triggerable within the game yet.

            <p class="blog-text">
              Reactive lighting has been implemented. While not crucial to
              gameplay itself, a requirement of this project is to immerse the
              player into a reactive and ‘alive’ nightclub scene. Having
              real-time reactive lighting is a show-off feature of my
              understanding of real-time audio data analysis, and also a great
              way to provide visual enhancement to the player’s experience.

              In order to achieve the best possible game, iterative (Agile
              development) changes need to be made. Based on the project
              proposal feedback, luckily no major changes are envisioned,
              however small detail changes in the gameplay mechanics are
              expected. For example, I have decided to re-think the way the game
              will award points in order to make the experience more worthwhile.

              This week, I have finished off the PowerPoint slides for the
              project proposal. The majority of information was already written
              in my game design document, however additional information had to
              be written due to it being previously missing or outdated since
              the last iteration of the prototype. Screenshots and a video were
              also made, and then edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.

            <p class="blog-text">
              This week, I implemented major features into the game. Ensuring
              that a duplicate number of NPCs does not spawn is crucial. There
              cannot be an equal number of NPCs spawning in, since that would
              cause a dilemma where the player will not be able to select the
              correct genre to get awarded points. Now, the game runs a check to
              see if there are no equal numbers of NPCs, and if so, adjusts the
              number of NPCs to be all different.

              A scoring system has also been implemented. All major sensing
              mechanics have been implemented, however, currently the game only
              awards points for playing any track, and also awards points for
              playing the most popular genres. Coroutines had to be used, and a
              lot of conditional statements. Since I have already anticipated
              appropriate music genre sensing, implementing scoring conditions
              was relatively simple. However, major parts of code had to be
              re-written for the spawning of NPCs and also allowing the scripts
              to globally manipulate clones of NPCs.

            <p class="blog-text">
              There currently is no UI or menu for the start of the game. I have
              begun implementing the main menu. I created buttons that are
              functionless placeholders, serving as a to-do list for UI features
              that need to be implemented. So far, the player can start the game
              and exit the game. Starting the game triggers the cutscene and
              then throws the player into the main gameplay. The other features
              are not a priority, and rely on the completion of the main game
              before implementing. Basic options will be added, a simple
              tutorial panel and also free play mode. Free play mode will be a
              duplication of the main game, therefore that must be finished
              first before free play mode is added.

              Based on the research, it is now important to apply the research
              into the project. The project has been made, GitHub has been
              selected for version control, and basic mapping and modelling has
              begun in order to provide the game with a barebone framework
              towards what needs to be implemented.

              It is important that the project contains a clear vision ahead. At
              this point, a development methodology must be selected. Solo Scrum
              Agile has been selected due to the iterative solo developmental
              nature of this project. Documentation and resources have also been
              collected and research has begun on the approach towards
              audio-analysis algorithms.
