It is important that the project contains a clear vision ahead. At this point, a development methodology must be selected. Solo Scrum Agile has been selected due to the iterative solo developmental nature of this project. Documentation and resources have also been collected and research has begun on the approach towards audio-analysis algorithms. Based on the research, it is now important to apply the research into the project. The project has been made, GitHub has been selected for version control, and basic mapping and modelling has begun in order to provide the game with a barebone framework towards what needs to be implemented.
