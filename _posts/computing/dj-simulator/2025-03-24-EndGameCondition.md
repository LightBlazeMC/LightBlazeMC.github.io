An end game condition is a must and even at this late point in development is still absent. In order to be able to test and debug the game properly from the beginning to the end, this must now be present. I have focussed on implementing this. A 5-minute timer has been added so that the player has a time limit to amass the most points. The duration of the timer may be adjustable in a feature in the settings/free play mode.

When the timer is over, the game will display the playerâ€™s score and return to the main menu. This has been implemented within the game manager, and a game over manager. Currently, the screen is very basic since it is in the testing stage, but a design in line with the aesthetics of the rest of the game will be implemented eventually.
