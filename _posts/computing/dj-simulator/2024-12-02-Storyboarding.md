Since it is important to provide the player with context as to why they are playing the game, I have decided to create a very simple intro cutscene consisting of several images. To keep frames and subtitles to a minimum, I have planned out the basic storyboard for the cutscene on paper. That way, I was able to eliminate any unnecessary shots/information and keep it short and concise.
