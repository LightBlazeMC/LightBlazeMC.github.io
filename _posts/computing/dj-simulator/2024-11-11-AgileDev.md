In order to achieve the best possible game, iterative (Agile development) changes need to be made. Based on the project proposal feedback, luckily no major changes are envisioned, however small detail changes in the gameplay mechanics are expected. For example, I have decided to re-think the way the game will award points in order to make the experience more worthwhile.

I have finished off the PowerPoint slides for the project proposal. The majority of information was already written in my game design document, however additional information had to be written due to it being previously missing or outdated since the last iteration of the prototype. Screenshots and a video were also made, and then edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.
