There currently is no UI or menu for the start of the game. I have begun implementing the main menu. I created buttons that are functionless placeholders, serving as a to-do list for UI features that need to be implemented. So far, the player can start the game and exit the game. Starting the game triggers the cutscene and then throws the player into the main gameplay. The other features are not a priority, and rely on the completion of the main game before implementing. Basic options will be added, a simple tutorial panel and also free play mode. Free play mode will be a duplication of the main game, therefore that must be finished first before free play mode is added. Basic features are now being prototyped, such as the crowd, the DJ decks and points awarding. This development phase is critical as it outlines the fundamental functionality necessary for the game.
