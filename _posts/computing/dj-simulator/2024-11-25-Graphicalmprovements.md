Reactive lighting has been implemented. While not crucial to gameplay itself, a requirement of this project is to immerse the player into a reactive and ‘alive’ nightclub scene. Having real-time reactive lighting is a show-off feature of my understanding of real-time audio data analysis, and also a great way to provide visual enhancement to the player’s experience.

The map is now ready to be enhanced with extra features. Posters have been designed and added, and barriers, doors and wall textures have been implemented. It is a good idea to get the game looking good now, as more showcases and demos are approaching, so it is important the game looks good to potential players and testers.
