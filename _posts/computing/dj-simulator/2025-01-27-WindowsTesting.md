Having developed the majority of the game on my MacBook Pro, I have decided to load up the project on my Windows 11 PC. I have done this so that I can make sure that the game runs well and works on different machines and operating systems. Having verified that the game runs exactly the same on my PC as it did on macOS, I have returned to continuing development on macOS, due the power and portability of my MacBook Pro.
