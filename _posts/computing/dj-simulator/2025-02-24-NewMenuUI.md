An in-game menu has been made in order to allow the player to return to the menu. This is a simple implementation, due to the fact that scene management logic for the main menu and cutscenes already exists, so that can be repurposed. It is important to have this menu, otherwise the player would have to force quit the game to select a different game mode, which of course is a very poor example of user experience.

A main menu has also been created. The design of it pays homage to classic simulation titles, such as Microsoft Flight Simulator.
