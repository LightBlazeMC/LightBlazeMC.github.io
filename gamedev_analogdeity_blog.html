              On the final day before submission, I have decided to manually
              port over the Google Docs style blog into an actual page within my
              static HTML portfolio site. This proved to be tedious, yet not too
              difficult. It was a good decision to do this since I now meet the
              specifications of the brief closer by having a dedicated blog
              website, and not just a Google Docs page.

              As the deadline for the project approaches, I have spent time
              researching various blog hosts that would be compatible with my
              static HTML site. I have tried Hugo, Jekyll and WordPress, however
              they all made substantial changes to my already written code,
              therefore I decided to keep the Google Doc blog format, but
              formatting the document in a way that resembles a blog page. I
              have then begun creating the project page for Analog Deity on my
              portfolio website, along with a link to the Google Doc page.

              replaced all instances of the default Text Mesh Pro font with the
              custom font. I have also implemented code that correctly tracks
