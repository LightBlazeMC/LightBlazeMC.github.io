              I have used the photocopier facilities at the university to create
              high quality scans of the planning sketches and I have shared them
              with the team for their reference, and also so that I can include
              it on the documentation. These sketches help quickly and
              efficiently implement the intended vision of the project, while
              minimising necessary iterations and improvement cycles. This
              greatly boosts efficiency of the projectâ€™s development and is a
              great and quick way to communicate information across the team.

              I have also met up with members of the team, and together we
              furthered in-engine implementations of the mentioned features,

              I have made rough sketches of the two deities present in the game.
              This is so that we can ensure that important characteristics the
              deities must possess are actually implemented into the game.y
              previous projects for the CSS layout and the HTML baseplates. This
              design will be iterated through in more detail as actual
              development occurs, but it sets the scene for what is necessary in
              order to accomplish a fully functioning gameplay mechanic.

              At this point, the documentation contains rough outlines
              showcasing the lore and gameplay mechanics that need to be present
              in the game. Doing such rough plans is important since it ensures
              no time is wasted implementing redundant and non-functional
              features. The development may now commence with a clear and
              planned out path ahead.

              All of the paper sketches can now be scanned in with a photocopier
              and applied onto the design documentation. This ensures a clean,
              legible presentation of the early iterations of gameplay designs
              and mechanics. Using traditional pen and paper was the fastest and
              most direct way of presenting ideas. AI was not used for this, due
              to the high level of nonsensical images it generates.

              In order to implement the cutscene, and segue into the main

              I have organised a team meeting in order to collate all stray
              ideas into a cohesive project. There were many individual ideas
              that were not organised as a whole. I made the aim of this week to
              be purely organisational. By the end of this week, the team was

              I have begun making space for the project page on my website.
              Since it is an HTML site, I had to code this in myself. In order
              to speed this up, I re-used elements from my previous projects for
              the CSS layout and the HTML baseplates.

              I have also begun compressing images so that the website loads
              faster. This is something I did not do before, and that caused
              pages to load a lot slower with full resolution PNG files. For
              this website, I have used compressed JPEG files that load fast and
              still are of a high enough resolution that it is legible.

              After the lore was established, I was able to compose a soundtrack
              to match the aesthetic and atmosphere of the game. I have used
              Logic Pro X to do this, since it provides excellent orchestral
              sounds. These paired with warped tape emulation provide an
              unsettling feeling that aligns well with the atmosphere of the
              game.

              We have sat down as a team and considered project scope and
              objectives. We have decided that since cutscenes are optional, we
              will reduce the time allocation and focus on that. In effect, we
              have decided to opt for a smaller cast and script. We have also
              changed our narrative from fully hand written to AI assisted, in

              considering the theme and vibe of the game. I have created the
